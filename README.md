# Better Autoexec
A higher performance version of the original addon from Zippy, it's not a rework or reupload, it's the same idea and a better implementation of it.

## Where is Lua code?
Written in [Yuescript](https://github.com/pigpigyyy/Yuescript), compiled Lua code can be found in [releases](https://github.com/PrikolMen/better-autoexec/releases), or you can compile it yourself using compiled [Yuescript Compiler](https://github.com/pigpigyyy/Yuescript/releases/latest).
